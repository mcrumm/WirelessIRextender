Arduino based 434MHz Wireless IR Extender
Intended for use with, but not limited to, a NinjaBlock.

As I posted here, http://forums.ninjablocks.com/index.php?p=/discussion/1392/wireless-ir-extender-lets-build-one

Capabilities:
1. Wireless IR Extender is a mini arduino that includes a RF receiver (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10532) and a IR LED.
2. NinjaBlock (NB) is able to send RF codes to Wireless IR Extender which will then be replayed via IR LED.
3. My first use for this Wireless IR Extender will be to control an Air Conditioner.

Progress:
Right now I'm just testing components. I am able to receive RF signals and decode them as binary utilizing the same library I see in the NB repository, https://code.google.com/p/rc-switch/ with included test sketch. I am also able to decode and replay IR signals using https://github.com/cyborg5/IRLib.
[Update] I created a basic flowchart for the arduino logic, https://plus.google.com/100877474955327466991/posts/XdTzDKRhvCU

Thoughts:
I want the Wireless IR Extender to remain simple. I want the IR codes to be stored in the NB code so that the arduino does not need to be updated each time a device is added.
I may include a IR sensor https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10266, and a RF transmitter https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10534, permenantly with the extender. Push a button and it will "listen" for 30 seconds giving you time to press a button on a control, then have that code wirelessly sent to your NB.

My Limitations:
I'm really no programmer. I've messed with arduinos and some wireless modules before but it has always been a lot of copy and pasting of code. I'm more concerned about being able to interface this device I create with the NB. I know they have done some great work with their documentation so when it comes time I hope I can figure it out. If not I'm hoping that the community will give me a hand.

I really think this could be cool as it will be more of a universal IR remote for the NinjaBlock.

Cheers,
